## Learning Journey:

🙌 This project was a deep dive into the world of npm packages, from basic initialization (`npm init`) to advanced Webpack features like code splitting. I took the initiative to build this project independently, applying the skills I've acquired recently without relying on tutorials.

## Continuous Learning:

🌱 Every project is a learning opportunity, and this one was no exception. I gained valuable insights into modern JavaScript, bundling techniques, and the power of npm packages. Excited to continue exploring and refining my skills!

## Gratitude:

🤝 A big shoutout to [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for providing a solid foundation and inspiring me to take on challenges independently.

## What's Next?

🚀 I'm already thinking about my next project and eager to explore new technologies and techniques. Stay tuned for more updates!
